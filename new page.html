I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
<ul>
<li> HTML is cool </li>
<li> CSS is cooler </li>
<li> JS is the best </li>
</ul>
